# Black Box Problem

Given a black-box fitness function, our goal is to solve problem instances 1, 2, 5 and 10 with the minimum number of fitness calls. \
We are allowed to implement any algorithm we can think of, no rules.

## Notes
I've implemented different variations of the algorithm but I did not have the opportunity to test them all and fine-tune them. \
Thus i did not obtain the best results possible, but I'm still satisfied with the results I got.

## Collaborations
I collaborated with [Davide Vitabile s330509](https://github.com/Vitabile), [Davide Sferrazza s326619](https://github.com/FarInHeight), [Simone Giambrone s317002](https://github.com/JustLooller) and [Andrea Panuccio s294603](https://github.com/AndPan96).
