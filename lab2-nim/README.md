## Collaborations
- I worked with (Davide Vitabile - S000000)[https://github.com/Vitabile] and (Davide Sferrazza - S000000)[https://github.com/FarInHeight], used their rule-based agent (tried to implement a rule for the k-limit variant, with not much success) and we developed the evolutionary agent together.
